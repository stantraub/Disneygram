## Background and Overview

Disneygram is an Instagram clone with a Disney-inspired twist. Users in the Disney universe are able to create accounts, login/logout, and view pictures. Post capability will be added in the near future. 

Features cloned from Instagram include:

User authentication

User Profile with picture grid layout
Likes
Comments

## Demo

## Technologies 

Disneygram was built with a variety of technologies. I used Ruby on Rails for my backend and React/Redux for my frontend. User information was stored in a database set up by PostgreSQL and images are stored via AWS S3. 

## Website Elements

### Signup/Sign In Page 

The Signup/Sign In is an almost exact clone of the instagram web app user authentication page. The font and background color are the same to match Instagram's website style. The iPhone template features a Disney castle gif superimposed on the phone.
